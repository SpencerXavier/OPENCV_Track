# WORK FLOW
End goal : do the training and inference  on nano to detect the smoke and notify the firefighter
PATH1 : Digits 

a.We use digits to do the training and test the inference on digits (30secs)
—we put the Dataset from drone and we can distinguishh the sky and lrerrin
— now we are trying feed the smoke data and label it to train and let it detect smoke
b. run the model on jestoon nano(edge device) to do inference(2 mins)
c. 

PATH2 : KERAS
- use keras to run it do the same thing

PATH3 : UC Berkeley;s algorithm 
build a container and storage place and use UC Berkeley;s algorithm
